Simplistic and very much work in progress gnome shell extension for hamster.

NOTE: this extension works with the hamster applet version built from sources.
the process is rather simple and described here:
http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/building-and-running/

To install:

pre. ./waf configure --prefix=/usr
sudo ./waf install


The extension now works with gnome 3.1+
Note that now just installing doesn't do - the extension has to be
apparently enabled. You can do that via gnome-tweak-tool (have to install from
repos)

*NOTE*: if you are running earlier version of shell, please use this revision:
3ee20e1add8567b889b8fcf550b17c7088333e0b

to have the hamster take the place in the center, run this thing:
@gsettings set org.gnome.hamster swap-with-calendar true@


Known issues:

* it's very minimal
