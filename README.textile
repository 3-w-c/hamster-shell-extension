Simplistic and very much work in progress gnome shell extension for hamster.

To install:

pre. ./waf configure --prefix=/usr
sudo ./waf install


The extension now works with gnome 3.1+
Note that now just installing doesn't do - the extension has to be
apparently enabled. You can do that via gnome-tweak-tool (have to install from
repos)

NOTE: if you are running earlier version of shell, please use this revision:

to have the hamster take up the place in the center, run this thing:
@gsettings set org.gnome.hamster:/org/gnome/hamster swap-with-calendar true@


Known issues:

* after reloading have to run main hamster app as this thing does not seem to be waking up the dbus thing
* it's very minimal
